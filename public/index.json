The design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to design a product. The number of steps varies depending on who you ask, but the main point is that its a cycle. The design process is a cycle because it is not a linear process. Engineers will go back and forth between the steps as they work on the design. The design process is also iterative. This means that the design will be improved over time.\nAn example diagram of the design process is shown above.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 2.1 Design Process 30 minutes 2.2 Design Brief 30 minutes 2.3 Design Constraints 30 minutes 2.4 Design Specifications 30 minutes 2.5 Design Requirements 30 minutes 2.6 Design Sketches 30 minutes 2.7 Design Models 30 minutes 2.8 Design Testing 30 minutes 2.9 Design Review 30 minutes 2.10 Design Iteration 30 minutes 2.11 Design Documentation 30 minutes 2.12 Design Presentation 30 minutes Total 6 hours "

	"content": "6.0 Programming In FRC there are 4 main programming languages that are used. These are Java, C++, LabVIEW, and Python. Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. The language that you choose to use will depend on your team\u0026rsquo;s preferences and the programming language that your mentors are most comfortable with. The programming language that you choose to use will also depend on the programming language that your team\u0026rsquo;s robot controller is programmed in. The robot controller is the computer that controls the robot. The robot controller is a NI RoboRio. The Roborio can be configured for any of the languages listed above.\nRobot code is also not the only type of programming done in FRC. Teams write GUI software for their drive stations, they make games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and they write code for their websites. Students also learn how to write low level firmware for devices like arduinos and raspberry pis. Programming is a very important part of FRC and students can come into FRC with little to no programming experience and leave with a very strong understanding of programming. The guides here are intended to help in that process and also expose students to the different types of programming that are done in FRC.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 6.1 Programming Languages 30 minutes 6.2 Java 30 minutes 6.3 C++ 30 minutes 6.4 LabVIEW 30 minutes 6.5 Python 30 minutes 6.6 Robot Code 30 minutes 6.7 Timed Robot 30 minutes 6.8 Command Based Programming 30 minutes 6.9 RobotBuilder 30 minutes 6.10 Path Planning 30 minutes 6.11 Robot Simulation 30 minutes 6.12 Vision Processing 30 minutes 6.13 ROS 30 minutes 6.14 GUI Programming 30 minutes 6.15 Unity 30 minutes 6.16 Unreal Engine 30 minutes 6.17 Web Development 30 minutes 6.18 Arduino 30 minutes 6.19 Raspberry Pi 30 minutes "

	"content": "What is programming? Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. It is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do and how to do it.\nProgramming languages are the languages used to write the source code of programs. There are many programming languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and rules. The four most popular programming languages used in FRC include Python, Java, C++, and LabVIEW.\nWhy do programming languages exist? Programming languages exist to provide a way for humans to communicate instructions to computers in a manner that they can understand and execute.\nComputers are essentially machines that perform operations based on a set of instructions. However, computers do not understand natural language like humans do, so programming languages provide a way for us to write code in a structured, formal syntax that the computer can interpret and execute.\nProgramming languages have evolved over time to become more user-friendly, easier to read, and capable of abstracting complex concepts into simple, high-level constructs. This makes it easier for humans to write and understand code, and allows for the creation of more complex programs.\nAdditionally, programming languages serve as a means of communication between developers, enabling them to share, reuse, and build upon each other\u0026rsquo;s code.\nIn summary, programming languages exist to provide a bridge between human language and the language of computers, enabling us to create software that can perform a wide range of tasks and solve complex problems.\nWhat is robotics programming? Robotics programming involves writing code that controls the behavior and actions of robots. This code can control how a robot moves, interacts with its environment, and processes information from sensors.\nThe basics of robotics programming usually start with understanding how to control the movement of a robot\u0026rsquo;s motors, how to gather and interpret data from sensors, and how to make decisions based on that data. This requires an understanding of the underlying hardware and how to communicate with it using code.\nOnce you have a basic understanding of these concepts, you can start writing code to control a robot\u0026rsquo;s movements, such as making it move forward, turn, and avoid obstacles. You can also write code that enables the robot to make decisions based on the data it gathers from its sensors, such as determining the distance to an object and avoiding collisions.\nOverall, robotics programming is an exciting and challenging field that combines both software and hardware skills. With time and practice, you can develop your skills and create more sophisticated robots that can perform complex tasks.\nThe next few chapters will guide you through the aspects of each programming language listed below this includes:\nSyntax: The set of rules and constructs that define how code is written in a particular programming language. This includes things like variable declaration, function definition, and control structures. Structure: The organization and arrangement of code, including the way in which code is indented, the use of white space, and the arrangement of functions, variables, and other constructs. Data Types: The different types of data that a programming language can handle, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and arrays. Input/Output: The mechanism for reading data from or writing data to the user or other external sources. Control Structures: Constructs that control the flow of execution of the program, such as loops, if-then-else statements, and switch statements. Error handling: The process of detecting and resolving errors in the program, such as exceptions, runtime errors, and debugging. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: A programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, each of which represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its data and behavior.

While the Learn Hugo Theme tutorial is a great resource for learning how to use Hugo, it does not cover how to design a knowledge website like frczero.org. For a teams website to be successful, it needs to be designed to be easy to use and easy to navigate. The learn theme may not be the best choice. The table below lists some of the most common themes for Hugo:\nTheme Name (link) Description Learn The learn theme is a theme designed for knowledge websites. Universal The universal theme is a GOOD choice for teams. Ananke The ananke theme is a theme designed for blog websites. Hugo Coder The hugo coder theme is a simple and clean blog theme. Theme.gohugo.io The theme.gohugo.io website lists many themes for Hugo. I used that to find these themes! How to Install Hugo on Windows (Properly!!!) Note: The following instructions are based on the Hugo Installation Guide\nDownload the latest version of Hugo from the Download the Windows ARM 64bit version or see the Hugo Releases page for other versions.\nExtract the zip file to a folder on your computer. (I recommend somewhere with a short path like C:\\hugo). The zip file should contain a single executable file named hugo.exe and a folder named LICENSE.md and README.md. If you try to run the hugo.exe file now, it will open a command prompt window and then close. This is because the hugo.exe program is not a gui program. It is a command line program. To run the hugo.exe program, you need to open a command prompt window and then run the hugo.exe program from the command prompt window. DO NOT DO THAT YET! Wait for step 7.\nOpen the command prompt window. To do this, press the Windows key and the R key at the same time. This will open the Run dialog box. In the Run dialog box, type cmd and then press the Enter key. This will open the command prompt window. (You should do this as an administrator. To do this, right click on the command prompt icon and then click on the \u0026ldquo;Run as administrator\u0026rdquo; option.)\nIn order to actually use the hugo command and not have to use C:/hugo/hugo.exe you need to add it to your PATH! To do this in the command prompt window type set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\hugo\\bin and then press the Enter key. (You should replace C:\\hugo\\bin with the path to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program.)\nChange the directory to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program. To do this, type cd C:\\hugo and then press the Enter key. (You should replace C:\\hugo with the path to the folder where you extracted the hugo.exe program.)\nTo test that the hugo command is working, type hugo version and then press the Enter key. This should print the version of Hugo that you installed. If it does not print the version of Hugo that you installed, then you should go back and make sure that you followed the instructions correctly.\nIf you are confident that you followed the instructions correctly, then you should try to reinstall Hugo. If you are still having problems, then you should submit an issue on the frczero.org github repo How can a team use the Universal theme and Hugo? Note: The following instructions are based on the Universal Theme Quick Start Guide. To see the theme in action, visit the Universal Theme Demo.\nCreate a new Hugo website using the following command:\nhugo new site my-website Change the directory to the new website:\ncd my-website Add the Universal theme to the website. There are 2 methods based on whether or not you have Git installed on your computer. If you do not have Git installed on your computer, then you should use the first method. If you do have Git installed on your computer, then you should use the second method:\nMethod 1: Download the theme as a zip file and extract it to the website:\nDownload the theme from the Universal Theme Github Repo as a zip file. Extract the zip file to the websites themes folder. If one does not exist, then create one. You need to rename the folder that you extracted from hugo-universal-theme-master to hugo-universal-theme. Method 2: Clone the theme using Git and add it to the website (Still rename the folder to hugo-universal-theme after cloning):\nmkdir themes cd themes git clone https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme Open up the website configuration file called config.toml and add the following content:\nstyle = \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;My Website\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-universal-theme\u0026#34; [params] disabled_logo = false logo_text = \u0026#34;Universal\u0026#34; logo = \u0026#34;img/logo.png\u0026#34; logo_small = \u0026#34;img/logo-small.png\u0026#34; You can go into much greater detail with the configuration file, but this is the bare minimum that you need to get started. To learn more visit the Universal Theme Configuration Guide.\nRun the project using the following command:\nhugo server Open up a web browser and go to the following address:\nhttp://localhost:1313/ You should see the following page:\nTo create a new page, run the following command (You should probably do this from a different command prompt window):\nhugo new page about.md Open up the new page in a text editor or VS code and add the following content:\n--- title: \u0026#34;About\u0026#34; date: 2019-01-01T00:00:00-05:00 draft: false --- Hello World! Save the file and then go to the following address in your web browser:\nhttp://localhost:1313/about/ You should see the following page:\nIf you are having problems, then you should go back and make sure that you followed the instructions correctly. If you are confident that you followed the instructions correctly and you are still having problems, then you should submit an issue on the frczero.org github repo Keep reading and following the official Universal Theme Quick Start Guide to learn more about the theme and how to make the most of it. You will have to rename the Menu tabs to match your team\u0026rsquo;s needed layout. This is done by creating files called partials in the layouts/partials folder. There are lots of examples of the partials in the themes folder and the exampleSite folder.\nWhen you are ready to publish your website, run the following command:\nhugo Note: When you run the hugo command, it will create a public folder. This folder contains all of the files that you need to upload to your webhosting service.\nHow can a team use the Ananke theme and Hugo? Note: The following instructions are based on the Hugo Quick Start Guide. This also assumes you have already installed Hugo on your computer.\nNote 2: The following instructions are based on the Ananke Theme Quick Start Guide. To see the theme in action, visit the Ananke Theme Demo.\n//TODO: These instructions are incomplete and students had issues following them at a recent workshop. They need to be updated. 1.

	"content": "What is a Falcon 500? The Falcon 500 is a motor and motor controller combination unit. It is a brushless motor with an integrated motor controller. The motor controller is a Talon FX motor controller. The motor is a brushless motor.\nLeaving aside any \u0026ldquo;Availability, Ethical (IFI Issues), Etc\u0026rdquo; The new Falcon v3s for the 2023 season have been noted to have a few issues. This page is a collection of fixes for those issues and to cover the basics of troubleshooting the Falcon 500 in the v1 and v2 variants as well.\nBefore you start, do you have your Falcon Fixing Kit? The Falcon Fixing Kit is a collection of tools and parts that you will need to fix the v1/v2 Falcon 500s. A B.O.M. for the v3 will be produced as soon as we get some\u0026hellip; The kit includes the following items:\nMedium Strength Loctite (Loctite 243) New screws for motor housings since the torx heads strip easily: Button Head Hex Drive Screw, Passivated 18-8 Stainless Steel, M3 x 0.50 mm Thread, 50mm Long McMaster-Carr Shaft shims 18-8 Stainless Steel Shims, for Shortening 5/16\u0026quot; Diameter Screw Shoulder, 0.02\u0026quot; Thick McMaster-Carr Hardened T10 Driver for case screws Bits, 1/4\u0026quot; Hex Shank for Power Tools, T10 Size McMaster-Carr Extended Hardened T8 bit for shaft screws Bits, 1/4\u0026quot; Hex Shank for Power Tools, T8 Size, 3-1/2\u0026quot; Long Overall Additional Notes from Chief Delphi User who came up with the B.O.M. above:\nI would also highly recommend you keep a bolt extractor set with left-handed drill bits and thread extractors. I had to use those on more than one occasion because the T10 case screws are soft and strip easily, or came out completely bent a few times after I fought them for an hour (hence the replacement screws above). We kept this set of tools and parts in the Falcon Un****** box and used it to QC verify (and fix) every one of the 32+ Falcon’s that passed through our shop last year.BOM Maker\u0026rsquo;s story from fixing them during the 2022 season\nContents for this Section Order Section Title 1. Wobbly Shaft 2. Broken Bolts 3. Missing Loctite 4. Overheating 5. Size Changes and Documentation Confusion 6. Falcon 500 V1 Teardown 7. Falcon 500 V2 Teardown 8. Falcon 500 V3 Teardown 9. Other Fixes Wobbly Shaft Teams who have bought Falcon v3 motors for the 2023 season have been reporting wobbly shafts. This is a result of the shaft tolerances being off and way out of the usual expected specs. It\u0026rsquo;s all a possible consequence of removing the shaft bolts(cuz they were loose cuz of missing loctite) It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not all motors, but teams ABSOLUTELY should check any v3 falcon 500s for this issue. Reddit Post identifying the issue\nFixes for the wobbly shaft 3d print a spacer to help keep the shaft on place. This can be the same falcon 500 spacers, but oversized by roughly 2mm. This came from the same reddit post, but has not been confirmed for a long term fix. Submit a RMA to VEX/CTRE/WCP for a replacement motor. This is a problem however as there are no parts for spares, vendors are out of stock for the remainder of the 2023 season https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-6515.html and if there are ones for RMA reserved, they will be subject to the same issue. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. Don\u0026rsquo;t use a v3 Falcon 500 unless you dont have any other options. This is absolutely a really subpar option, but if you have no other options, you have no other options. Broken Bolts Teams who have bought Falcon 500s of all variants have been reporting broken bolts. This is a result of the bolts being too soft and stripping out or snapping. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has been exacerbated by the new v3 falcons. These include longer screws that are too long in some cases and they were over tightened.\nFixes for the broken bolts Replace the bolts with stronger ones. This is a good option, but it is not ideal as Teams paying $220 for a motor should not have to replace the bolts. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. If you break a bolt, you can use a bolt extractor to remove the broken bolt. This is a good option, but can lead to damaging the threads if not done correctly. A guide on how to do this can be found here Many teams will not be in a situation that they would need to be removing bolts except for the other issues listed here. If you are in this situation, and you need to remove bolts you should seriously consider the risks involved and the potential damage to the motor. Missing Loctite Teams who have bought Falcon 500s of all variants have been reporting missing loctite. This seems like not a big deal, except the bolts are crucial to the performance of the motor and its overall safety. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has been fixed/exacerbated by the new v3 falcons. The rush to get the v3 falcons out the door while trying to avoid this has led partially to the wobbly shaft, and this is something seemingly to have been overlooked as a consqeuence of trying to fix it on the v1 and v2s in the past. Without the loctite, the bolts can come loose and cause the motor to fail during a match or practice.\nFixes for the missing loctite Replace the bolts with stronger ones. This is a good option, because more than likely you will strip/snap a bolt trying to QA inspect your bolts for loctite. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors. While I would normally recommend not taking apart a motor, this is a situation where you should take apart the motor and inspect the bolts. If you find a bolt without loctite, you should replace it with a stronger bolt as with all of the bolts and you should add loctite to the bolts. Use the 243 as listed in the BOM above. Overheating The Falcon 500 motors are High-Performance motors, and as such, they are designed to be able to handle a lot of power. However, they are not designed to be able to handle a lot of power for a long period of time. The motors are designed to be able to handle a lot of power for a short period of time, and then they need to be allowed to cool down. This is a problem that has been around for a while, but has possibly been improved by the v3. The jury is still out on this one. The motors feature air cooling ports that can be attached to your pneumatics system. A guide for this is here under the section called \u0026ldquo;Using the Falcon 500 Cooling Port\u0026rdquo;. Many teams who are not familiar with this, or don\u0026rsquo;t see the benefit of it, will not use it. This is a problem that will lead to burnt out and overheated motors.\nFixes for the overheating Use the cooling ports. This is a good option and is what the port is literally made for. Monitor the motors temperature. This is a good option, and it can help you know when you should let air in the ports to conserve air and the motor. This requires some extra work, but the Phoenix Motor controllers using the IMotorController interface have a method called getTemperature() that can be used to get the temperature of the motor. This reports the data in celsius\u0026hellip; but whatever. Java API Doc Don\u0026rsquo;t use the cooling ports. This is a bad option, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to monitor the temperature, or you don\u0026rsquo;t have working pnuematics on the bot you can just not use them. This is a problem that will lead to burnt out and overheated motors. This is done at the risk of the Team choosing to not use the port. Rather silly if you ask me. Size Changes and Documentation Confusion Something that caught many people off guard is the new larger size of the v3 vs the v1/v2 models. The v3 size is correct in the cad model, but the website for the Falcon 500 only has a v2 2D drawing. While most teams would instinctively use the updated 3D model, some teams may grab the 2D v2 in a rush and not notice the size difference until its time to assemble it all. This would mean redesigning things in a hurry or having to use the v2/v1s that are smaller. This is a problem that will need to be addressed by the vendors and they need to update the website to reflect the correct size of the v3.\nFixes for the size changes and documentation confusion Use the v3 3D model. This is a good option, and is the correct option. If you are not using a v3 then this is not an issue for you. Falcon 500 V1 Teardown We have a teardown of the Falcon 500 V1 motor.

	"content": "Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.\nIn FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism. Cylinders are usually measured by the stroke length, bore diameter, and rod diameter. The stroke length is the distance the piston can travel in one direction. The bore diameter is the diameter of the cylinder. The rod diameter is the diameter of the piston. The bore and rod diameters are usually the same. They can also come in a large variety of sizes and styles.\nA typical pneumatic system in FRC can look something like this:\nImage courtesy of FRC 358\nBelow is a downloadable copy of FIRST\u0026rsquo;s pneumatics guide.

	"content": "Pneumatic components are the parts of a pneumatic system that use compressed air to do work. There are many different types of pneumatic components. The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:\nComponent Description Image Vendor Link(s) Solenoid A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. Solenoids can be 12v or 24v. There is a jumper on the PCM for this and it sets the voltage level for ALL solenoids attached to it. The solenoids are marked for which voltage level they are meant to work with. Andymark Double Solenoid A double solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. It has two ports, one for air in and one for air out. Solenoids of both kinds are usually attached to manifold Andymark Compressor A compressor is a device that uses an electric motor to compress air. It is used to provide the air pressure for a pneumatic system. Teams can prefill tanks with an offboard compressor board. It must still use the PCM as its controlling hardware. Andymark Pneumatic Cylinder A pneumatic cylinder is a device that uses compressed air to extend and retract a piston. These can come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes.

	"content": "Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.\nSafety Rules Never use compressed air to propel a projectile. Never apply compressed air to the skin or direct it at a person. Even air at a pressure of 15 psig can cause serious injury. Never use a compressed air hose to clean dirt or dust from your clothing or body. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup. Wear ear protection. Exposure to excessive noise can damage hearing. Noise reducing mufflers can be fitted to machines to lessen the noise health hazard. Never use frayed, damaged or deteriorated hoses. Always store hoses properly and away from heat sources or direct sunlight. A hose failure can cause serious injury. Hose Reels can decrease your chances of injury, as well as help hoses last longer. Potential Hazards Tank Shattering Hearing Damage (Loud Compressor) Solenoid Failure (Misfiring mechanism) PCM Failure (Lack of control or Pressure Feedback) Air Leak (This can force hoses to slip off fittings) "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Setting up a pneumatic system can be a daunting task. This section will cover the basics of setting up a pneumatic system. It will cover the basics of the components and how to connect them. It will also cover the basics of how to setup the compressor and the PCM and how to test the system.\nGatherings the Components The first step in setting up a pneumatic system is to gather the components. The components are listed below:\nCompressor Release Valve Pressure Switch Pressure Gauge x2 Manual Release Valve Air Tank Pressure Regulator Solenoid Pneumatic Hose Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Pneumatic Control Module (PCM) or Pneumatic Control Hub (PCH) Compressor The air compressor is the heart of the pneumatic system. It is the device that compresses the air and stores it in the air tank. The compressor is connected to the PCM and the PCM controls the compressor. Compressors will automatically run unless the pressure switch is above the set pressure limit. The compressor can also be manually turned on and off from the robot code. The PCM and the compressor are connected with a 12V power cable. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub.\nThis is a close up of the wiring for the compressor and the PCM.\nRelease Valve The release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if the pressure switch is overridden. All excess air pressure over 125psi will be released automatically when tuned properly. This is checked and tested by the inspectors.Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until competition to find out that your release valve is not working. Test it before you get to competition and while initially putting the system together.\nThis is a close up of the release valve.\nPressure Switch The pressure switch is used to control the compressor. The pressure switch is connected to the PCM next the compressor. The pressure switch is used to turn the compressor on and off. The pressure switches\u0026rsquo; air port is connected to the system on the high pressure side. By default the pressure switch is set to 120 psi. The pressure switch should NOT be adjusted. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. If the pressure switch is adjusted, the team will have to replace it with a stock one.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure switch.\nPressure Gauge (High Side) Pressure guages help us (humans) see the current PSI of the system using an analog (not electrical analog) dial indicator. The pressure gauge is connected to the system on the high pressure side. The best way to be able to use it is to put it somewhere that you can see it. Many teams will connect a T fitting to the high pressure side and then connect the pressure gauge and the pressure switch to the T-fitting(s). This allows the pressure gauge to be easily seen and the pressure switch to be easily connected. If it is also located near the manual release valve, it can be used to check the pressure before releasing the valve.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure gauge.\nManual Release Valve The manual release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The manual release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if a lever is pulled or a ball valve is turned. All air pressure from the system will be released when the valve is opened. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. This is a safety feature that is required on all FRC robots that store compressed air. It should be easily accessible and easy to use after a match has ended.\nThis is a close up of the manual release valve.\nAir Tank The air tank(s) are also located on the high side of the system. The tanks with either have a 1/4\u0026quot; NPT port or a threaded port to attach your own connectors. Whenever you are adding a new fitting, or removing an existing one, on a tank you need to:\nMake sure the tank is empty Wrap the threads with Teflon tape Tighten the fitting (Don\u0026rsquo;t over tighten) Check for leaks with a low pressure fill test before adding to your full system Add soap and water to an old spray bottle and spray the fittings to check for leaks. If you see bubbles, you have a leak. This is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the air tank.\nPressure Regulator The pressure regulator is what sets the PSI level for the low side of the system. Best practice is to set the pressure regulator to 60 psi. Solenoids can operate at more or less pressure by adjusting the regulator. Most regulators have a knob that can be turned to adjust the pressure. In order to adjust it you have to first pull up on the knob and then turn it. Clockwise increases the pressure and counter-clockwise decreases the pressure. The pressure regulator has an input side and an output side. Make sure which is which! The input side is sometimes marked with an triangle like in the picture below. The input side is the side that is connected to the high pressure side of the system. The output side is the side that is connected to the low pressure side of the system.\nThis is a close up of a pressure regulator.\nSolenoid In order to control the flow of air we use a special type of valve called a solenoid. Solenoids are controlled by the PCM or PCH. The solenoid has a port on the input side and a port on the output side. The PCM or PCH will send a signal to the solenoid to open or close the valve. The solenoid will open or close the valve depending on the signal it receives. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub. The block underneath the solenoid is called a manifold. The manifold is used to connect the air ports to the solenoid.\nThis is a close up of a solenoid and manifold.\nPneumatic Hose There are many vendors that sell the proper hose for pneumatic systems. The hose is measured by the inside diameter (ID) and the outside diameter (OD). The OD is the size of the hose and the ID is the size of the port that it connects to. The OD of the hose should be 1/4\u0026quot; and the ID of the port should be 1/4\u0026quot;. The hose should be flexible and not kink easily. The hose should be able to withstand the pressure of the system (125 psi MAX). Below is a table with the different types of hose and their pressure ratings with a column for the vendor with a link to the product page:\nVendor Hose Type Pressure Rating Link McMaster-Carr Polyurethane 150 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 125 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 116 Official/125 Tested PSI Link VEX Polyurethane Not Listed PSI Link Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Fittings and connectors can vary wildly from vendor to vendor. The fittings and connectors should be able to withstand the pressure of the system (125 psi MAX). Below is a table with the different types of fittings and connectors and their pressure ratings with a column for the vendor with a link to the product page:\nVendor Fitting Type Pressure Rating Link McMaster-Carr Push to Connect 150 PSI Link AndyMark Various 125 PSI Link VEX Push to Connect Not Listed PSI Link Below is a chart with some images of the different types of fittings and connectors. Please note teams will have different names they use as casual names for the fittings and connectors. The names in the chart are the official names for the fittings and connectors:\nFitting/Connector Image Description Push to Connect Threaded 1/4\u0026quot; NPT port Push to Connect fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. Push to Connect to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT Push to Connect to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hoses and fittings between the various styles of connectors. Push to Connect (T Connector) This type of connector splits off into 3 ends that can have Push to Connect ends Threaded 1/4\u0026quot; NPT (T Connector) This type of connector splits off into 3 ends that can accept 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT (T Connector) 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. There are also smaller types of fittings that are typically used for the solenoids. These are typically 1/8\u0026quot; NPT fittings. These are typically used for the solenoids and are not typically used for the main air lines. They can have a smaller diameter hose and are typically used only on the low pressure side of the system.\nUsing all of the combinations of fittings and connectors, you can create a wide variety of pneumatic systems. Your team will need to figure out what works best for your team\u0026rsquo;s unique hardware setup. Below are some example pneumatic fitting images in the context of FRC to help you get started:\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nConnecting the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP Finally we can go through the process of connecting up the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. The PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using a 2 wire daisy chain commonly used in FRC called CAN. CAN or Controller Area Network is a serial bus that is used to connect multiple devices together. The RoboRIO and PDP are both CAN devices and the PCM or PCH is also a CAN device. You can support up to 63 CAN devices on a single CAN bus. most devices in the system will have 2 seperate Channels for in and out, except the Roborio which is a special case. The Roborio is always the starting point of your CAN connection in FRC.\nIn logical order the wiring for CAN should always go like this: RoboRIO -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PCM or PCH -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PDP (have the termimating resistor jumper active on the PDP)\nIn a system with no other CAN components, like CAN motor controllers or sensors, the PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using the following diagram:\nThis is a close up of the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. Note: The process is the same for both! This diagram was made in Fritzing. I dont have a PCH fritzings part so I used the PCM part. The PCH is the same as the PCM for CAN connection.\nThe power connections for the PCM or PCH are as follows:\nBattery Positive -\u0026gt; Breaker -\u0026gt; PDP Positive -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Positive through their dedicated and marked ports\nBattery Negative -\u0026gt; PDP Negative -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Negative through their dedicated and marked ports\n"

	"content": "Pneumatic control is the process of controlling the flow of air to the pneumatic system. This is done by using solenoids to control cylinders of various shapes and sizes. All of the cylinders are controlled using the same basic hardware. At a minimum, if you have followed along you should have a compressor, a pressure switch, a release valve, and a solenoid. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot. The compressor and solenoids are controlled by the PCM/PCH. The pressure switch stops the compressor if it detects anything above 125 psi. In case that fails there should ALWAYS be a mechanical safety valve that is properly tuned.\nWithout diving into the code portion yet, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the hardware. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot so far. The compressor will just automatically run nonstop until a certain max PSI limit is reached. This assumes there is code for enabling the compressor somewhere in your code. A guide for this including with the changes for 2023 is here for Java and C++.\nControlling the Different Solenoids via Code There are two different types of solenoids that are used in FRC. The first is the single solenoid. This is the most basic solenoid and is used to control airflow in a single direction. The second is the double solenoid. This is used to control two different directions of airflow. Both have some basic commands for controlling them. This is an example from wpilib for the single solenoid. An example for the double solenoid is here.\nOperating the Solenoids Manually (Without Full Code) NOTE: You still need to have the rest of your system enabled and controlled with the PCM/PCH properly. This is just a way to manually control the solenoids without having to write code for it. This is useful for testing and debugging.\nMany of the FRC solenoids feature a button on their top. When this is pressed it forces the solenoid to change the direction of the air flow. This should be done with EXTREME CAUTION as you will be right next to the solenoid, and given the laws of space and time, probably near the cylinder you\u0026rsquo;re gonna set off.\nThe button on the top of the solenoid is used to manually change the direction of the air flow.\nControlling the Air Compressor in Code with Better Feedback By using an analog pressure sensor, teams can get much more detailed information about the pressure in the system. This allows for more accurate control of the system. This is especially important for teams that are using a compressor that is not controlled by the PCM/PCH. This is a guide for using the analog pressure sensor in Java and C++.\n"

	"content": " Sometimes things dont work as expected. This section will help you troubleshoot your pneumatic system.\nCommon Issues with Pneumatics Pneumatic solenoids are not working Check the solenoid wiring. Is the solenoid wired to the PCM? Is the solenoid wired to the correct channel? Is the solenoid wired with the correct polarity? Check the solenoid. Is the solenoid plugged in? Is the solenoid broken? If using a manifold, check the manifold for a proper seal If its a double solenoid, check they are both not firing at the same time Check the PCM. Is the PCM powered? The PCM is connected to the PDP and there is a small 20A fuse on the PDP for it and the VRM to share. Check the status of this fuse. Is the PCM wired to the correctly via CAN? Does it have the proper CAN ID? The PDP and PCM should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have the same CAN ID of 0! All of the FRC libraries assume this ID setup! Is the PCM firmware up to date? A guide to updating the PCM firmware can be found here as well as a general primer to CTRE CAN devices. For more specifics about troubleshooting for the PCM check here Is the system enabled? Check the code to make sure the system is enabled. Check the dashboard to make sure the system is enabled. Is the Robot Status Light flashing or solid? If flashing, the robot is enabled If solid, the robot is disabled but powered on. If off, the robot is not powered on. Is the system full with enough air to move the cylinder? Check the pressure gauge to make sure the system is full. Check the pressure regulator to make sure the low side level is set to around 60 psi for most teams. Pneumatic solenoids are not firing at the same time Check the Previoisly mentioned items for the solenoids. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are firing at the same time. If using a double solenoid, only use one k.direction command at a time. Check where the solenoids are being fired from. If they are being fired from different commands they will never truly be firing at the same time. The command scheduler will only run one command at a time for a subsytem. If you want to fire both solenoids at the same time, you will need to fire them from the same command. If using a timed robot, check that whatever functions are firing the solenoids are not being called seperately. If they are, they will not be firing at the same time. Are both solenoids using the same types of fitting and length of tubing? If not, the solenoids will not be firing at the same time. The solenoids will be firing at different times depending on the length of tubing and the fittings used. a. The amount of air needed to move the cylinder is dependent on the length of tubing and the fittings used. There are specifically fittings with screw caps that let you fine tune the pressure for each solenoid or cylinder. If yes, check for any physical leaks on the solenoids or the tubing connections. a. Get an old bottle with a spray nozzle and spray a SMALL amount soapy water on the connections. If bubbles appear, there is a leak. The System is Never \u0026ldquo;Full\u0026rdquo; and the Compressor Runs Forever Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) If the low pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the pressure regulator may be setup incorrectly. Check the direction of the pressure regulator. The high side is the inlet and the low side is the outlet. Check the low side pressure. It should be around 60 psi for most teams. If the high pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the system is not full and has no air stored. Check that all manual valves are closed. Check all pneumatic fittings for leaks. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. Check the pressure switch. If it is broken, the compressor may NEVER turn off. The System is Full but the Compressor Runs Intermittenly at Rest NOTE: Some air loss is unavoidable. The compressor will run to keep the system full. If the system is full and the compressor is running anyways, this is NOT normal. Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) Check for leaks at all connection points. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. If the release valve is not tuned properly it may be letting air out of the system too early. If the pressure switch has a loose connection or is broken, the compressor may operate intermittently. The PCM has a Sticky Fault Check the PCM for a sticky fault. Check the phoenix tuner self test. There is a clear sticky fault button on the self test menu! I have no idea if this can happen to the PCH but phoenix is only for CTRE products so I am assuming not. Check the status light on the PCM. Whats a sticky fault? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared by the code. This means that the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can happen if the code is not running or if the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can also happen if the PCM is not wired to the CAN bus properly. What makes it sticky? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared easily with a reboot. The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Compressor Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Run Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the compressor is enabled. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the compressor enable command is NOT the traditional setClosedLoopControl(true) command. The new command is setDigitalEnable(true) for Java. Another new deprecated command is enabled(). This function checked the status of the compressor. Now it is called isEnabled() for clarity. Check the WPIlib documentation for more information here The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Solenoids Don\u0026rsquo;t Fire Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are set to the proper port number and PneumaticsModuleType. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the solenoid objects are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are Solenoid exampleSolenoidPCM = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1); for a PCM, or Solenoid exampleSolenoidPH = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 1); for a PCH. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the double solenoids are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePCM = new DoubleSolenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1, 2); for a PCM, or DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePH = new DoubleSolenoid(9, PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 4, 5); for a PCH.

	"content": "What is Fusion 360? Fusion 360 is a 3D Design, CAM, and CAE tool from Autodesk. It is a cloud-based tool that allows you to design, simulate, and manufacture your robot. It is available for free to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams. Students and Mentors should sign up for a free account at https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured\u0026amp;filters=individual. After you setup or activate the Fusion 360 Educational access you should download it from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\nWhat are some of the Pros and Cons of Fusion 360 vs. other CAD tools? Pros Cons Free for all FIRST Robotics Competition teams Cloud-based Available on Windows \u0026amp; Chromebooks Collaboration is easy File Viewer available for iOS and Android Cloud-based Teams Setup can be confusing How do I get started with Fusion 360? 1. Download Fusion 360 Download Fusion 360 from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\n2. Install Fusion 360 Install Fusion 360 on your computer. You can also install the Fusion 360 app on your mobile device to view your designs on the go.\n3. Sign into your Fusion 360 account Sign into your Fusion 360 account. Double check that you are signed into the correct account. If you are not signed into the correct account, you can sign out and sign back in with the correct account. The fusion 360 Education account is different from the Personal account and has much more functionality. Your files and team connections will be different for each account as well.\n4. Create a new Fusion 360 Team or join an existing team If you are creating a new team, you will need to create a new team name. If you are joining an existing team, you will need to know the team name. The educator in charge of the \u0026ldquo;license seats\u0026rdquo; should also send a team invite email to make the process smoother, but it is not required.\nYou can always join a team later if you are not sure what team you are on. You can also create a new team later if you are not sure what team you are on or want to seperate your projects and work spaces with different organizations.\n5. Create a new Fusion 360 Project Create a new Fusion 360 Project. You can create a new project for each year or for each project. You can also create a new project later if you are not sure what project you are working on just yet. When making a new project, you can choose what to name it, where it is stored and more. If you dont know what to name it, you can always change it later, but you should know what you intend to make before you start trying to make it. \u0026ldquo;Robot Ideas\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are just starting to work on. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023 - Chassis\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season and is just for the chassis.\n6. Create a new Fusion 360 Design Create a new design by clicking on the + at the top of the screen. If you just opened Fusion 360 it opens with a new empty design called Untitled by default. You cannot import any outside parts or components into that design until you save it somewhere and give it a proper name.\nImporting parts and components into a design is covered in the next section. One other thing to note about your design before you make anything is to double check the Document Settings: units value to make sure its in whatever system you prefer (Metric or Standard).\n7. Import parts and components into your design If teams think ahead they can put all 3rd party vendor files into organized folders and then import them into their design. This will save a lot of time and effort later on. If you are just starting out, you can import parts and components into your design as you need them. You can also import parts and components into your design later if you are not sure what you need just yet.\nIf you are uploading a new part to Fusion 360, you can upload it from your computer by hitting the Upload button, then either browsing or dragging and dropping the files. Fusion is best at handling NON-MESH files like STEP. It can handle many types, but meshes like STL, OBJ, and FBX are not as good and will slow fusion to a crawl on even the beefiest of gaming computers.\nIf you are importing a part from a vendor, you should try to keep the original part names for the files. Vendors like McMaster-Carr and REV Robotics have a lot of similar parts and it is easier to find them if you know the part number.\nHow can I find a vendor part STEP file to even import? NOTE: every vendor has a different process for this. This is just a general overview of how to find a STEP file for a part. If you are having trouble finding a STEP file for a part, ask your mentor or a team member who has done it before. FRC discord and Chief Delphi are great places to ask for help also.\nVendor CAD Resources Link AndyMark (STEP Files) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=STEP%20Files/ AndyMark (2D Drawings) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=PDF%20Drawings/ VEX Robotics https://www.vexrobotics.com/pro/all/?q=empty\u0026amp;vex_site=cads VEX Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Search) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/Search.aspx?arg=FRC\u0026amp;SortBy=match\u0026amp;PageSize=10\u0026amp;contentsourcefilter=Supplier%7CPlastic%20Supplier%7C-UserSupplied%20(SupplierAgent)%7CUser\u0026amp;suppliernavigator=VEX%20Robotics REV Robotics (CAD General) https://docs.revrobotics.com/docs/rev-ion#cad REV Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Page) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/parts/supplier/REV-Robotics.aspx 9. Making a plate for the Power Breaker in Fusion 360 Step 1: Import the Power Breaker STEP file into your design. This one is tricky to find so im going to link download a copy I have hosted here. This one originally came from here.\nStep 2: Create a new sketch on the bottom face of the Power Breaker. This is the face that has the 4 holes for the screws. NOTE: Only 2 of the holes are used for the screws. The other 2 are for the Battery Positive line. You can ignore those holes.\nThis is what the sketch should look like. The sketch is a 2D representation of one face of the 3D model. You can see the 3D model in the background. The sketch is on the \u0026ldquo;bottom face\u0026rdquo; of the 3D model.\nStep 3: Select both screws by Ctrl + Clicking on them. Then clicking on the drop down at the bottom of the create tab, select the \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; option near the bottom of the list. This will project the edges and lines that make up our bolt holes onto the sketch. This is a very useful tool for making holes in plates and other parts from existing 3D models.\nStep 4: Add a centered rectangle around the middle of the breaker. This is still part of the same sketch. For this short example you can just eyeball the center of the breaker. For more complex parts you can draw center lines or project more edges to get midpoints.\nStep 5: The size of the plate should leave plenty of room for easy safety access and leaving enough room for bolts with even a really thin material.\nStep 6: Finish the sketch by clicking the check mark at the top of the screen. This will take you back to the 3D design mode with your sketch visible. Now we can select the rectangle and extrude it out to make the plate. Note the extra pieces from the edges might get selected. You want the entire rectangle to be highlighted blue except for the holes. If you have extra pieces selected/unsleected, you can click on them with the Ctrl key held down to deselect/reselect them.\nStep 7: With the sketch of the plate selected still, click the \u0026ldquo;Extrude\u0026rdquo; button. This will bring up the extrude dialog. You can rotate the 3d model to get a better view of the Distance Arrow. As you drag it up and down, you can see the plate get thicker and thinner. You can also type in a value in the box. I used 0.25 inches since this is a fairly thick size that works for even the weakest of materials. You also need to check the Operation section carefully. There are 5 options all with different purposes.\nNew Body - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is what we want to do here. New Component - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Join - This will add the shape of the sketch to the existing part part. This is not what we want to do here. Step 8: Click the \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; button to finish the extrusion. This will create a new part in your design. You can see the new part in the tree on the left side of the screen. You can also see the new part in the 3D view. The part will be under Bodies and given a default name. You can rename it by double clicking on it in the tree or right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026rdquo;. You can also convert it to a component by right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Create Component from Bodies\u0026rdquo;. Finally if you did turn it into a component you could now export it, send a copy to a team mate or even convert the body inside of our component into a STL to be 3d printed.\n// TODO: Add a step for adding a hole for the battery positive lines.\n!!!YOU JUST MADE YOUR FIRST PART IN FUSION 360!!!\n"

Thats just how it is!\n+++\rtitle = \u0026#34;0.0 About FRC0\u0026#34;\rdate = 2023-02-04T22:22:45-05:00\rweight = 0.0\rchapter = true\rlastmod = 2023-02-04T22:22:45-05:00\rauthor = \u0026#39;Mr. Siefen\u0026#39;\reditors = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\r+++ "

It has alot of non-FRC content, but it is focused on robotics, stem, iot, and other not as relevent topics. docs.wpilib.org - The documentation for WPIlib. This should be considered the standard and Official \u0026ldquo;gold source\u0026rdquo; of information for FRC. It is the most complete and up to date source of information for FRC for many topics. Where possible, this site will link to the WPIlib documentation. REV Robotics - A company that makes motor controllers and other hardware for FRC. CTRE Phoenix - A company that makes motor controllers and other hardware for FRC. AndyMark - A company that makes parts for FRC. They also supply field game pieces. The standard K.O.P. (Kit of Parts) chassis is made by AndyMark. It is tried, tested, and proven to work. FIRST Robotics Competition - The official website for FIRST Robotics Competition. The Blue Alliance - A website that tracks FRC teams, events, and matches. The metrics and data on this site are used to help teams improve, learn about teams near them, and to help teams find other teams to compete with during offseason events. The Blue Alliance is another community effort. It is a great resource for teams and mentors. gm0.org - A website that teaches FTC teams how to do\u0026hellip; well just about everything related to FTC. It is a great resource for FTC teams and mentors. It was the original inspiration for this site and our benchmark to match for quality and content. Seriously, go check it out. It is a great resource.
