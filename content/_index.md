# Welcome to FRC0 (FRC Zero)

This is the home page for FRC0 (FRC Zero).  FRC0 is a knowledge base for students, mentors, and parents of FIRST Robotics Competition teams.  The goal of FRC0 is to provide a single source of information for all things FIRST Robotics Competition.  This includes information on the game, the rules, the robot, and the competition and much more.  FRC0 is a work in progress.  We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve the site.
